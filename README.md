# Codespaces CodeQL

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running CodeQL! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore CodeQL.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click **Publish Branch** and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

## Running the code tour

We've set up a code tour to help you get familiar with the basic concepts of CodeQL and show you how to run CodeQL queries. To run the code tour:

1. In your codespace, at the bottom of the File Explorer, expand **CODETOUR**.
1. Under **CODETOUR**, expand the **CodeQL tutorial**, then click **#1**. 
1. In the resulting pop up in the Editor, follow along with the tutorial, and press **Next** when you're ready to move on to the next step.

Once you've finished the code tour, your CodeQL environment will be all set up and ready to use! You can continue to explore the CodeQL template we've made for you, and execute your own CodeQL queries.

## Running simple CodeQL queries

You can use this codespace to learn about the concepts of CodeQL, without having to analyze any code. If you would like to use CodeQL to analyze your own projects, you can follow the instructions in [Setting up CodeQL in Visual Studio Code](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/setting-up-codeql-in-visual-studio-code/) to set up your own CodeQL environment. 

To run simple CodeQL queries in this codespace:

1. Right click on `codeql-tutorial-database` in the file explorer and select **CodeQL: Set Current Database**.
1. Edit the `tutorial.ql` file to write a CodeQL query.
1. Once you've written your query, right-click within the `.ql` query file, and click **CodeQL: Run Query**, or
1. Open the Command Palette with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`, start typing "CodeQL", and click on **CodeQL: Run Query**.

## Further learning 

You can find [CodeQL tutorials](https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/ql-tutorials/) in our CodeQL documentation. The tutorials introduce concepts that you can use this codespace to practice.

We also have [CodeQL language guides](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-language-guides/) to help you experiment and learn how to write effective and efficient queries for CodeQL databases generated from the languages supported in CodeQL analysis.
